Lab 15a

- Ted and Alice both should have done a git pull origin master to both of their master branches, ensuring they were on the same page before continuting to work.
- Bob and Carol should have also done a git pull origin master before starting their new feature.
- Teams should always be working on branches rather than within the master.
